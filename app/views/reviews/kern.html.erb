        <p class="flow-text">My query for beaulieu is:  how to reconcile the notion that the concrete poems of <a href="http://www.lesfigues.com/book/kern/"><b>KERN</b></a> are “logos and slogans for ‘pataphysically impossible businesses”, as written in the 'Author's Note' (KERN, 90), with the idea that “[c]oncrete poetry...interferes with signification and momentarily interrupts the capitalist structure of language”, as written in "<a href="http://www.ubu.com/papers/beaulieu_concrete_commentary.pdf">an afterword after words: notes toward a concrete poetic</a>", from beaulieu's earlier work <a href="http://talonbooks.com/books/fractal-economies"><b>fractal economies</b></a> (fractal economies, 80)? For me, the praxis of the latter quote negates the economics of the former. Alternatively, is this just exactly why such businesses are ‘pataphysically impossible -  is it that such businesses are operating doubly outside the economics of capitalism (yet remaining businesses), as well as outside the linguistic structures capitalism generates, hence their concrete status? </p>

          <p>Similarly, I’m interested in the ordering of poems when beaulieu also writes that “‘Kern’ attempts to refuse linearity in favour of the momentary” (90). This statement most likely refers to the pieces individually rather than the work as a whole. This is because "KERN" begins with a compact, fully centered, tightly woven poem where the surrounding whitespace contributes to a palpable density akin to the way “the Nike swoosh sits on a shoe”, and ends with an alpha-(z)omega pyrotechnic textful godsmacking double pageblang, the way "neon overwhelms the Tokyo streetscape", the work’s progression is surprisingly linear (90). From initial minimalistic designs repeating limited selections of typographical elements, the book progresses into ever more complex - and intricately chaotic -  poems...or are they performances, designs, illustrations, or logos... beaulieu is right when he writes, “there is still no accepted critical vocabulary for concrete poetry” (fractal economics 79). I am left speechless to decode these “inarticulate marks” (fractal economics 80). Instead, this cumulative and culminating formatting powers a linear narrative which works “extralinguistically” (KERN 90). </p>
