        <p> Let me pull from one of Steff's bios:
           <pre class="steff">Steffanie Ling is a writer, mostly...Currently, she is writing a book of letters and stories that weigh in on banality, social awkwardness and smoking.</pre>

    <p> The rhythmic dangle of that first sentence</p>

            <p> With its ambiguously hanging near-apocopic, adverbial modifier</p>
            <p>and comma pause.</p>

            <p> The phrase "book of letters" </p>

            <p> In a interview with Sung Pil Yoon of <a href="http://spare-room.ca/"><u>Spare Room</u></a>, Steff refers to some of these poems as "word-based" poems</p>

            <p> In that same interview, Steff refers to these poems as hovering between concrete poetry and minimalist poetry</p>

            <p> The attention here to componentization, to words, to letters, to categorization: what the activity of writing includes or excludes: concrete poetry viz. minimalist poetry</p>

            <p> As object, as book of ['letters', 'words'], as ['word', 'letter']-based poems, the work comes wrapped as a bánh mì sandwich would, papered and taped and crinkling </p>

            <p> The sheets are large - think A2 size - folded in half, with one poem on each folded page inside</p>

            <p>  Heavy weighted unripened-olive coloured hardcarded paper holds the unbounded, loose sheafs of paper inside</p>
            <p> Yes, the book is unbound - instead, each page is loose and stacked, like thin cuts of meat</p>
            <p> Each sheet/slice contains two poems </p>
            <p> This particular formatting allows a near boundless permutability to the work</p>
            <p> There is also a table of contents on the inside of the cover</p>
            <p> But while the poems ostensibly have titles, these aren't included on the page of the poem </p>

            <p> Still, with a bit of work, you can figure out which title may have been intended for which poem </p>
            <p> If you were to rearrange these loose sheets in every combination possible, there would be <strong>39,916,800</strong> different ways of ordering the work</p>
            <p> Although there is no overt over-arching organizing principle of this work, each re-ordering would nevertheless produce its own reading, producing a unique context within which to read the works off each other</p>
            <p> The work kind of deflates and sort of exaggerates this absurdity by blessing(?) the work with its semi-functional table of contents</p>
            <p> Wait</p>
            <p> Since the poems do not reference a title specifically on their page, each poem could be retitled in each reordering</p>
            <p> This leaves us with the possibility of <pre>809, 429, 852, 527, 344, 373, 968 ,162, 284, 449, 350, 829, 970, 823, 063, 097, 016, 070, 457, 762, 336, 284, 976, 604, 266, 405, 217, 133, 917, 739, 979, 101, 827, 382, 870, 741, 850, 789, 049, 568, 566, 634, 393, 183, 827, 450, 477, 162, 148, 411, 476, 507, 217, 602, 230, 720, 921, 600, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 00, 000, 000</pre><p>different variations of the book  </p>
            <p> Nice</p>
            <p> The reading order I read may not have been the order you read </p>
            <p> The poems are slivers, mostly</p>
            <p> Thin slices of text cutting across a page surrounded by a vast albescence</p>
            <p> Deliberately miniscule font-sizes further accentuate the enormity of the encompassing white space</p>
            <p> This in turn magnifies and clarifies each line</p>
            <p> Such near-blank pages, with minimal textual interventions allows each work (word) to accrue a kind of density </p>
            <p> A kind of focus</p>
            <p> There is a visual symmetry at play in a number of these poems:
              <pre>
             Do you want a glass of water? I'm getting a glass of water.
             I'm getting a glass of water. Do you want a glass of water?</pre> </p>
             <p> It is a visual poem of two equally lengthed strips of text</p>
             <p> It is linguistic poem that is a palindrome at the level of the sentence </p>
             <p> Its voice: urgent, banal; reversals, mirrors</p>
             <p> Your imagined inflections while reading it</p>
             <p> How repetition punctures banality </p>
             <p> How minimalist poetry punctures blank pages</p>
             <p> How repetition redoubles one's attention</p>
             <p> Like when someone asks you twice if you want a glass of water</p>
             <p> Another quasi-palindrome, semi-anagrammatical poem reads:
             <pre class="center-align">
  emiles
  smiles</pre></p>
              <p> Again, a visual symmetry </p>
              <p> That upon closer inspection goes awry</p>
              <p> Minimalist formalism architecting verbal and visual spaces</p>
              <p> The errant inclinations of the poem, its deviation from 100% pure sense suggest the dizzying folds - the infinite ridges - of interpretation, the translucence of thin meat, its wavery form, its malleability, its almost liquid adaptation (like language) to its environment, the way that, as the errant trickster Hamlet puts it, "one may smile, and smile, and be a villain", which is in any case, a similar dislocation of the verbal and the visual</p>
              <p> The flourish, the wooping double 'e', the unfolded answer me 's', and textually, visually, their tripartite trinity</p>
              <p> <pre class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">

              <p> Four words and six syllables</p>
              <p> The ennui, the quotidian argot, the cliche discourse, the diatribe, the gentrification, the two breaths it takes, the political weight of words under capital</p>
              <p> Its updated objective correlative, marked by banalities contra imagery</p>
              <p> How much time imagery takes</p>
              <p> Another poem is simply the word "painting" with many, many "i's", and even more dots per 'i' than would be possible to produce on a keyboard</p>

        <p><span class = "note"></span><strike>One last thing, if I can get the audio to the track, I'll link it here</strike> GOT IT: <br>
          <%= audio_tag("steff-language-wall.mp3", class: "center-img", controls: true) %>
          <br>so in the interview I mentioned above, and that most precious audio file right up there, Steff gives her first reading of these poems, and the poem she reads is the word "wall", except it is the word "wall" with many, many more "w's" and "a's" than we usually find it with before the final two couplet-like "l's" which are left unaltered to give some general semblance to the "word" we generally think of as "wall", although visually it is pretty much completely almost unrecognizable as any word since it has so many letters, think maybe like thirty "w's" and just as many "a's", although again, that godless table of contents still decides to call this poem "wall" if that's worth anything at all, but even beyond quasi-semantico-visually resembling the word "word" "wall", but of course the poem also visually stretches across the entire page and so also looks like an actual wall of language, as Steff reads through the poem, she reads each letter aloud, as separate, not as a single drawn out long-breathed word, but as letter, "double-you double-you double-you" (remember all those 'i's in the poem "painting"?) she reads each letter complete with a myriad of tonal inflections, slight variations in pitch and pace, pauses which differentiate and accent nuances between spoken and seen letters, some of which drone out over longer periods of time, some of which are spoken rapidly and staccatoing, and here, although it is ostensibly Steff's first reading, a definite compelling rhythm develops, especially as the timbre shifts from vocal frying to fuller breathed voicings, which are staggered by both the audience and Steff sometimes laughing aloud, but still what we realize as each letter is uniquely spoken aloud is that each spoken letter is a unique instantiation of itself in the world, entangled in its immediate context to which it points, marks thoroughly, and dissolves, and here between the poem punctuated by breaths and pauses these letters become a sonic drone that sound less like individual letters and more like some inchoate gestalt of language, some dash of an <em>Ursprache</em>, although of course we learn to speak with words, not letters, but still then eventually we learn to granularize, componentize words into letters, visualize the sonic - categorize - which is exactly what these poems are doing already, bringing attention to their "word-based"-ness, their letter-based-ness, their language-ness against blank-ness, what the suffix -ness- does to a word, illuminating both what's caught in its attempted categorization, cataloguing the days in the week, and what might just slip through such attempts, how difficult or impossible it can be to articulate and recount these imperatives of categorization, just as Steff's bio tells us how she is a "writer, mostly", the extra comma, the tacked on adverb, the minimal intervention most interesting</p>
